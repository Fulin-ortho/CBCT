# Deep learning-based dental anomalies and pathologies identification for orthodontic treatment
by Juan Li et al.

## Introduction
This repository is for our paper 'Dental anomalies and pathologies identification for orthodontic treatment: an artificial intelligence-based study'.

## Release
The training, data preparation and testing codes have been released.

## Inference

Write the full path of the CBCT data (.nii.gz) in the file.list, and set up in the run_test.py.
Run the model:  run_test.py.

## AI inference application

Due to data privacy considerations, datasets are not available publicly but can be obtained upon reasonable request. For researchers interested in applying our segmentation system to their own CBCT data, we offer an AI inference service. To utilize this service, please complete the AI inference application form available at the following link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xzFugXfz_coKepT_2PrGH5OwtR6mbUGX/view?usp=sharing and submit it to Fulin Jiang at jfl@cqu.edu.cn. Upon receipt of the completed application form, we will provide a data upload link and deliver the segmentation results within two weeks. This approach ensures that our system can be effectively utilized in various clinical settings while maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the data.
